## Description
Libraries used:
- Pygame

The project uses **Python3** and the concept of OOPS (Classes) to model real-life objects as ship, alien fleet, bullets, scoreboard, etc.

The class methods (public and protected) demonstrate encapsulation and help in defining the behavior of the objects.

Finally, one can use **auto-py-to-exe** module to convert the python files into an .exe (executable) file.

## To Run the Game
1. Install pygame dependency using       **pip install pygame** 
2. Download all the python files and the images folder in the repository to your desired location.
3. Appropriately change File path to images in:
    - Line 15 in alien.py
    - Line 15 in ship.py
4. Run alien_invasion.py in the terminal.

*Optional:*   Make changes in settings.py to alter game speed, etc. to suit player requirements.
